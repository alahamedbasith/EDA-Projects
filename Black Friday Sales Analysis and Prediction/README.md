**Black Friday Sales Analysis and Foundation of Model Building for Prediction**

## Executive Summary
In this project, we aimed to build a predictive model for customer purchase amounts in order to help a retail company, "ABC Private Limited," create personalized offers for their products. The dataset contains information about customer demographics, product details, and total purchase amounts for selected high-volume products from the previous month. Our primary focus was on model building, but we conducted some initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
